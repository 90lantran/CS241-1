    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        These problems are designed to help familiarize you with the C standard library functions
        for manipulating strings.  These functions differ from those you have seen in C++, unlike 
        std::string in C++, strings in C are merely NULL-terminated byte arrays.
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p>
        To begin working on this project you first make the project use the make command.  This will 
        create two executables, ds1 and ds1_std.  The ds1 executable is compiled using the functions 
        implemented in ds1.c, and the unit tests in test.c.  Initially the executable will run and 
        indicate that most of the unit test have failed, it is your task to modify ds1.c to properly 
        implement the string functions called from test.c (you are encouraged to look at this file 
        too).  As an example of a fully functional implementation you may run ds1_std, it contains the 
        test.c file compiled against the C standard library string functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Compile and Run</h2>

    To compile these programs, run:
    <blockquote>
        make clean<br />
        make
    </blockquote>

    To run your own implementation (ds1.c):
    <blockquote>
        ./ds1
    </blockquote>

    To run the standard library implementation:
    <blockquote>
        ./ds1_std
    </blockquote>
