    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The <tt>malloc()</tt> contest is started. The functions of
        the <tt>malloc</tt>-family which are included in
        the <tt>libc</tt> library have been carefully designed to
        achieve excellent performances and low memory
        fragmentation. The <tt>libc</tt> has been developed since the
        late 1980s, acquiring more and more refinements and
        performance tweaks. So, do you think you can do better? Of
        course you can! And you have two weeks to demonstrate it to
        the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Playing with <tt>malloc()</tt></h2>
    <p>
        You may have noticed that the files included for this
        discussion section are pretty much the same as those included
        in the MP2. There are several reasons for that, among which:
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Implementing a good <tt>malloc()</tt> requires concentration</li>
	  <li>Good ideas come from mistakes</li>
	  <li>Nobody wants to mess up with the MP file tree</li>
	</ul>
	
	So, this DS2 is your personal mess-proof space for
	the <tt>malloc()</tt> contest: the place where you can test how
	bad a badly implemented <tt>malloc()</tt> can run; the place
	where you can test additional (experimental) tweaks to improve
	your submitted <tt>malloc()</tt>; the place where you can put as
	much buggy code as you want being confident that nobody will
	give a look into it; and finally the place where your mistakes
	does not represent negative points on the final grade of this
	MP.
    </p>

    <h2>Files Overview</h2>

    
    We provide two types of files: 

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>mreplace.c / mcontest.c / alloc-contest.c /
        debug.h</b>: <span style="color: #880000;">Don't edit these
        file!</span><br>  These files create the system environment to
        ensure that calls to <tt>malloc()</tt> and related memory
        functions are passed on to <b>your</b> memory functions and
        not the standard libc ones. You should not edit this file, as
        we will replace it with a new, clean copy when we run your
        program.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <b>alloc.c</b>: <span style="color: #008800;">Edit this
        file!</span><br>  This file provides blank implementations
        of <tt>malloc()</tt>, <tt>realloc()</tt>, and <tt>free()</tt>.
        Since <tt>calloc()</tt> is a trivial modification
        of <tt>malloc()</tt>, we provide a working version
        of <tt>calloc()</tt> that makes use of your <tt>malloc()</tt>.
      </li>
      
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Compile and Run</h2>
    
    <p>
      Much more detailed instructions on how to compile and run the
      files included in this packet are available on
      the <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/mp/MP2/doc/index.html">MP2
	page</a>. However, a quick way to get started is:
    </p>      
    <blockquote>
      make clean<br /> make
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      After a successful make, you will have compiled
      your <tt>malloc()</tt> as a shared library object (.so) and can
      use the launcher to launch the test cases included in the
      package or <b>any</b> Linux program using your allocation
      library. To do so, run:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ./mreplace tester-1<br />
      ./mreplace tester-2<br />
      ./mreplace tester-3<br />
      ./mreplace tester-4<br />
      ./mreplace &lt;Program Name&gt; [&lt;Program Args&gt; ...]
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Once you get it working, it's time to know how good your
      implementation is. The parameters that will be used to benchmark
      your <tt>malloc()</tt> are:
      
      <ul>
	<li>Maximum heap usage</li>
	<li>Average heap usage</li>
	<li>Time to run program</li>
      </ul>

      Thereby, to run the benchmark yourself, you can use the
      provided <tt>mcontest</tt> executable:

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ./mcontest &lt;Program Name&gt; [&lt;Program Args&gt; ...]
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      Time to get started! Bootstrap your ideas, prepare your shells.
