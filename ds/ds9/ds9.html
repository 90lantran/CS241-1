	<h2>In Discussion Section</h2>
	<p>
        The main part of this discussion is to program interprocess communication using <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/pipe">pipes</a>, and use <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/select">select()</a> to perform I/O multiplexting.
        <ul>
            <li>The parent creates two separate pipes to communicate with two (<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/fork">fork()</a>'ed) child processes. (The child processes communicate only with the parent, not with each other.) The children only write to their respective pipes, and the parent only reads from the pipes.
            <li>The parent uses select() to read from the two pipes as soon as data is available</li>
        </ul>
	</p>

    <p>
      The framework/relevant code is in <tt>ds9c.c</tt> (which you will complete) and <tt>ds9c-child-work.c</tt> (which does not need to be modified). You may start working on <tt>ds9c.c</tt> immediately, or you may work on <tt>ds9a.c</tt> and <tt>ds9b.c</tt> first, which serve as a more gentle introduction to pipes.


	<h2>Compiling and Running</h2>
	<p>To compile and run, use the following commands from a terminal on a Linux machine:</p>
	<blockquote>
	$ make<br />
    $ ./ds9c<br />
    $ ./ds9a<br />
    $ ./ds9b<br />
	</blockquote>
